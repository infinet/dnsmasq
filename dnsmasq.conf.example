# Configuration file for dnsmasq.
#
# Format is one option per line, legal options are the same
# as the long options legal on the command line. See
# "/usr/sbin/dnsmasq --help" or "man 8 dnsmasq" for details.

# Change these lines if you want dnsmasq to serve MX records.
# Only one of mx-host and mx-target need be set, the other defaults
# to the name of the host  running dnsmasq.
#mx-host=
#mx-target=
#selfmx
#localmx

# The following three options make you a better netizen, since they 
# tell dnsmasq to filter out queries which the public DNS cannot
# answer, and which load the servers (especially the root servers) 
# uneccessarily. If you have a dial-on-demand link they also stop
# these requests from bringing up the link uneccessarily.

# Never forward plain names (with a dot or domain part)
domain-needed
# Reply to reverse queries for addresses in the non-routed address
# space with the dotted.quad address
bogus-priv
# Filter useless windows-originated DNS requests
filterwin2k


# Change this line if you want dns to get its upstream servers from
# somewhere other that /etc/resolv.conf 
#resolv-file=

# By  default,  dnsmasq  will  send queries to any of the upstream
# servers it knows about and tries to favour servers to are  known
# to  be  up.  Uncommenting this forces dnsmasq to try each query
# with  each  server  strictly  in  the  order  they   appear   in
# /etc/resolv.conf
#strict-order

# If you don't want dnsmasq to read /etc/resolv.conf or any other
# file, getting its servers for this file instead (see below), then
# uncomment this
#no-resolv

# If you don't want dnsmasq to poll /etc/resolv.conf or other resolv
# files for changes and re-read them then uncomment this.
#no-poll

# Add other name servers here, with domain specs if they are for 
# non-public domains.
#server=/localnet/192.168.0.1

# Add local-only domains here, queries in these domains are answered
# from /etc/hosts or DHCP only.
#local=/localnet/

# Add domains which you want to force to an IP address here.
# The example below send any host in doubleclick.net to a local
# webserver.
#address=/doubleclick.net/127.0.0.1

# You no longer (as of version 1.7) need to set these to enable 
# dnsmasq to read /etc/ppp/resolv.conf since dnsmasq now uses the
# "dip" group to achieve this.
#user=
#group=

# If you want dnsmasq to listen for requests only on specified interfaces
# (and the loopback) give the name of the interface (eg eth0) here. 
# Repeat the line for more than one interface.
#interface=
# Or you can specify which interface _not_ to listen on
#except-interface=
# Or which to listen on by address (remember to include 127.0.0.1 if
# you use this.)
#listen-address=

# If you don't want dnsmasq to read /etc/hosts, uncomment the
# following line.
#no-hosts
# or if you want it to read another file, as well as /etc/hosts, use
# this.
#addn-hosts=/etc/banner_add_hosts

# Set this (and domain: see below) if you want to have a domain
# automatically added to simple names in a hosts-file.
#expand-hosts

# Uncomment this to enable the integrated DHCP server, you need
# to supply the range of addresses available for lease and optionally 
# a lease time. If you have more than one interface, you will need to
# repeat this for each interface on which you want to supply DHCP
# service.
#dhcp-range=192.168.0.50,192.168.0.150,12h

# Supply parameters for specified hosts using DHCP. There are lots
# of valid alternatives, so we will give examples of each. Note that
# IP addresses DO NOT have to be in the range given above, they just
# need to be on the same network. The order of the parameters in these
# do not matter, it's permissble to give name,adddress and MAC in any order

# Always allocate the host with ethernet address 11:22:33:44:55:66 
# The IP address 192.168.0.60
#dhcp-host=11:22:33:44:55:66,192.168.0.60

# Always set the name of the host with hardware address
# 11:22:33:44:55:66 to be "fred"
#dhcp-host=11:22:33:44:55:66,fred

# Always give the host with ethernet address 11:22:33:44:55:66
# the name fred and IP address 192.168.0.60 and lease time 45 minutes
#dhcp-host=11:22:33:44:55:66,fred,192.168.0.60,45m

# Give the machine which says it's name is "bert" IP address
# 192.168.0.70 and an infinite lease
#dhcp-host=bert,192.168.0.70,infinite

# Always give the host with client identifier 01:02:02:04 
# the IP address 192.168.0.60
#dhcp-host=id:01:02:02:04,192.168.0.60

# Always give the host with client identifier "marjorie"
# the IP address 192.168.0.60
#dhcp-host=id:marjorie,192.168.0.60

# Enable the address given for "judge" in /etc/hosts
# to be given to a machine presenting the name "judge" when
# it asks for a DHCP lease.
#dhcp-host=judge

# Send options to hosts which ask for a DHCP lease.
# See RFC 2132 for details of available options.
# Note that all the common settings, such as netmask and
# broadcast address, DNS server and default route, are given
# sane defaults by dnsmasq. You very likely will not need any
# any dhcp-options. If you use Windows clients and Samba, there
# are some options which are recommended, they are detailed at the
# end of this section.
# For reference, the common options are:
# subnet mask - 1
# default router - 3
# DNS server - 6
# broadcast address - 28

# Set the NTP time server addresses to 192.168.0.4 and 10.10.0.5
#dhcp-option=42,192.168.0.4,10.10.0.5

# Set the NTP time server address to be the same machine as 
# is running dnsmasq
#dhcp-option=42,0.0.0.0

# Set the NIS domain name to "welly"
#dhcp-option=40,welly

# Set the default time-to-live to 50
#dhcp-option=23,50

# Set the "all subnets are local" flag
#dhcp-option=27,1

# The following DHCP options set up dnsmasq in the same way as is specified
# for the ISC dhcpcd in 
# http://www.samba.org/samba/ftp/docs/textdocs/DHCP-Server-Configuration.txt
# adapted for a typical dnsmasq installation where the host running
# dnsmasq is also the host running samba.
# you may want to uncomment them if you use Windows clients and Samba.
#dhcp-option=19,0           # option ip-forwarding off 
#dhcp-option=44,0.0.0.0     # set netbios-over-TCP/IP nameserver(s) aka WINS server(s)
#dhcp-option=45,0.0.0.0     # netbios datagram distribution server
#dhcp-option=46,8           # netbios node type
#dhcp-option=47             # empty netbios scope.
 

# Set the boot filename and tftpd server name and address
# for BOOTP. You will only need this is you want to
# boot machines over the network.
#dhcp-boot=/var/ftpd/pxelinux.0,boothost,192.168.0.3

# The DHCP server needs somewhere on disk to keep its lease database.
# This defaults to a sane location, but if you want to change it, use
# the line below.
#dhcp-leasefile=/var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases

# Set the cachesize here.
#cache-size=150

# If you want to disable negative caching, uncomment this.
#no-negcache

# Normally responses which come form /etc/hosts and the DHCP lease
# file have Time-To-Live set as zero, which conventionally means
# do not cache further. If you are happy to trade lower load on the 
# server for potentially stale date, you can set a time-to-live (in 
# seconds) here.
#local-ttl=

# If you want dnsmasq to detect attempts by Verisign to send queries
# to unregistered .com and .net hosts to its sitefinder service and
# have dnsmasq instead return the correct NXDOMAIN response, uncomment
# this line. You can add similar lines to do the same for other
# registries which have implemented wildcard A records.
#bogus-nxdomain=64.94.110.11

# For debugging purposes, log each DNS query as it passes through
# dnsmasq.
